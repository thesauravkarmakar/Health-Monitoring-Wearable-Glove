# Health-Monitoring-Wearable-Glove-
Wearable devices are the new trend.These devices collect data from the person wearing the device (like pulse, location, sleep etc.) and send to the cloud for storage and analysis.
Wearables are considered as the biggest innovation in technology since the smartphone â€“ and the possibilities in this are endless.
Health Monitoring Wearable Glove which can be worn and used to display the heart rate of any individual on the display mounted on the glove. The pulse on a person is sensed using a pulse sensor, which sends information to the Lilypad Arduino board to command the LCD to display the heart rate.

Main Components are:
Lilypad Arduino\
Pulse Sensor Amped\
TM1637 Display\
FTDI Connector
